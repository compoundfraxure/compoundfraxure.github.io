I am a big fan of the YouTuber <a href="http://youtube.com/jacksfilms">Jacksfilms</a>, and every so often, he imposes a challenge to make something called Jack's Challenge. So for the 3rd one, I made a thing:

Jack also has a series called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA6687CF25DE17420">Your Grammar Sucks</a>," so I decided to make a thing in Javascript that converts any grammatically correct piece of text and misspells anything it can find using actual misspellings from YGS.

You can try it yourself <a href="/comments/">here</a>.
