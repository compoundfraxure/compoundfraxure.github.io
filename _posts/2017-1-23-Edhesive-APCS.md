title:  "What Happened to the Edhesive APCS Solutions?"

Some of you may know that I once kept a repository on GitHub that contained a number of solutions for the AP Computer Science massive open online course run by Edhesive (when I took it, it was called Amplify). Nobody in my class really cared about actually doing the work or took the class seriously, save for a select few (including me, but even I succumbed to periods of not caring throughout), so I decided to post all of the solutions I had saved on GitHub publicly at the end of the course.

Two years later, after learning that posting coding solutions on a public GitHub repo would get you charged with academic misconduct at the university level, I decided to pull the plug because of that and because my repo was showing up **really** high in Google search.

I was glad that I hadn't been found out by Edhesive by now since educators really don't like it when solutions are publicly available. I don't think I would get sued since I didn't even have all the solutions, the worst I imagine would happen is just a copyright takedown.

To be fair though, the course is completely free, and if you cheat in class, you'll be the one wasting money on the AP Test. Also, the course is nearly identical year after year with not many variances (from what I can tell). But I still stand by my decision.

I guess I didn't realize that my repo was actually semi-popular until 7 people contacted me in the two days since I pulled the solutions. But I guess that's what showing up fifth in Google when you search "Edhesive AP Computer Science" does.

If you need help with the course (because I remember the difficulties I had), send me a DM on Twitter and I can help you: [@CompoundFraxure](https://twitter.com/compoundfraxure).
